# Introduction

Digital emblems is a catch-all term for mechanisms that convey information
of legal, compliance, or other significance associated with an asset that need
to be verified and should inform the behavior of entities validating the emblem. Several
use cases for digital emblems cover emblems that already have legal definitions.
This makes the entities that define acceptable forms of those emblems required
stakeholders of this Working Group. Today, there exists no accepted collection
of standards for issuing, applying, or validating digital emblems that need to
be recognized under international law.

These use cases are specified and explored in greater detail in
(https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-haberman-digital-emblem-ps/).

# Problem Statement

While the format of digital emblems is expected to maximize reuse of existing
standards, emblem application and validation mechanisms may differ based on
a number of different conditions. Discovery of the digital emblem may differ
based on the type of asset being protected. Binding of a digital emblem to an
asset will depend on the distribution mechanism associated with the digital emblem.
Validation methods are dependent upon the criteria defined by the issuing entity.
These conditions will need to be explored as a part of documenting the use cases
supported by a digital emblem standard.

# Goals

This Working Group will focus on creating new standards or defining the reuse of
existing standards for issuing digital emblems, applying digital emblems to
assets, and validating digital emblems. In the process, it will coordinate with
other IETF Working Groups (e.g., SPICE, DRIP, SCITT, etc.) on the proper reuse of
existing IETF standards. Additionally, the Working Group will liaise with
external organizations responsible for defining acceptable uses of their legally defined emblems.

This Working Group considers the following goals in scope. The first milestone
of this Working Group will be to (1) gain consensus with entities responsible
for defining acceptable uses of their legally defined emblems on requirements
and (2) based on those requirements, identify which portions of these goals
require novel work and which should be given to other Working Groups that may
already own related scope. Divergent requirements between such stakeholders
may result in distinct units of work, but this determination is left to this
first milestone of the Working Group.

- Define reusable format(s) for Digital Emblems
- Define validation mechanism(s) for Digital Emblems
- Define discovery mechanism(s) of Digital Emblems

# Deliverables
The following are proposed deliverables and their target status:

- Use cases and requirements (Informational)
- Framework (Informational) describing conceptual model of operation and key terminology
- Data model and validation (Standards Track)
- Discovery (Standards Track) (multiple)

### BoF v2 discussion TODO: should this WG adopt both digital and physical assets?

It is not typical for IETF work to address the expectations of entities that are
legally responsible for determining if a standard is suitable for a given use
case. However, the digital emblems space has several such entities who own emblems
recognized under international law. This Working Group will only develop solutions
when the corresponding entity is actively engaged (in addition to the typical
engagement of future implementors) to avoid inventing solutions that cannot be
adopted by their intended audience.
